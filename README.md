# KÜHL Shop

This document keeps track of our core principles and mission statement that guide our daily descision making. Everything essentially just boils down to: make kühl shit.

## What is kühl shit?

- **App ideas stay SIMPLE.**  
If you can't explain it to a 5-year-old, it's probably too complicated.  
Simplicity prevents scope creep.

- **Always price fairly.**  
One of my biggest motivators in building software is:  
*"I could do that better and cheaper!"*  
The world needs more lean, simple ideas.

- **All users are clients. All clients are partners.**  
Most valuable features come from users themselves.  
Therefore, they are more than users—they are your partners.  
Show them love, care, interest, and generosity to reflect this.

- **Ship new features frequently.**  
Always be testing, tweaking, and fine-tuning products.  
Stagnation is the death of momentum.

- **Embrace losing, before winning**  
Generosity is rewarded in unseen ways. When you offer more value than your receiving, in any transaction, you're being nice while also taking a leap of faith that you'll potentially reciece more in the future. This is a bet on human nature and your clients' success. A big bet. We like bit bets.

- **Give the expected service—plus your unique added value.**  
This is what creates a unique experience, and thus, a superbly happy customer.  
*"A surprised customer is a happy customer."*

- **Engage in "priceless market fit."**  
Don’t see code as THE solution.  
Find the quickest solution—without sacrificing quality—until the market has been tested.

- **All content must provide more value to the user.**  
The goal of creating content is _not_ for the sake of creating content.
It must provide value to the end user. Whether that's education, entertainment or something else.
Increasing brand awareness and leads is the beneficial byproduct.

## Why the name KÜHL?

My adopted father, Leonard Geen Kühl, had incredible work ethic, treated my mom exceptionally, and was the most caring father I could have every asked for. He became my father when I was 5, and sadly passed away when I was 10. He died during an open heart surgeory procedure. A procedure he only needed, because he had excerted so much effort trying to save my mom and I from drowning, that he blew a ventrical in his heart. I'm not exaggerating for effect. My dad literally died trying to save my mom
and I. I only had him for 5 years of my early life. But for the time I had him, he had an effect on me that lasts to this day. I'm building this company because I'm passionate about my vision, and to honor my dads name.

Rest in peace, dad.
