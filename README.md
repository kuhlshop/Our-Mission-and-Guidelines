# KUHL Shop

This document keeps track of our core principles and mission statement that guides our daily descision making. Everything essentially just boils down to: Make kühl shit.

## What is Kühl Shit?

- **App ideas stay SIMPLE.**  
  If you can't explain it to a 5-year-old, it's probably too complicated.  
  Simplicity prevents scope creep.

- **Always price fairly.**  
  One of my biggest motivators in building software is:  
  *"I could do that better and cheaper!"*  
  The world needs more lean, simple ideas.

- **All users are clients. All clients are partners.**  
  Most valuable features come from users themselves.  
  Therefore, they are more than users—they are your partners.  
  Show them love, care, interest, and generosity to reflect this.

- **Ship new features frequently.**  
  Always be testing, tweaking, and fine-tuning products.  
  Stagnation is the death of momentum.

- **Embrace losing, before winning**  
  Generosity is rewarded in unseen ways. When you offer more value than your receiving, in any transaction, you're being nice while also taking a leap of faith that you'll potentially reciece more in the future. This is a bet on human nature and your clients' success. A big bet. We like bit bets.

- **Give the expected service—plus your unique added value.**  
  This is what creates a unique experience, and thus, a superbly happy customer.  
  *"A surprised customer is a happy customer."*

- **Engage in "priceless market fit."**  
  Don’t see code as THE solution.  
  Find the quickest solution—without sacrificing quality—until the market has been tested.
